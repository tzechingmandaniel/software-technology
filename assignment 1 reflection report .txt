Summarise:
In this assignment I have learnt many codes, I have learnt how to simplify the code, sometimes we can use classes to group a big amount of data and it is easier to use the data from the classes.


Improve:
If I have one more time to do this coding, maybe I’m going to make the code more simplify and make more classes to store the data
